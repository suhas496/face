This repository contains a Python-based face detection project leveraging a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine. It offers an easy-to-implement solution for detecting faces in images and video streams using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Detects faces in images and in real-time too.
- Utilizes a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to customize.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
- A pre-trained face model from Google Teachable Machine


-Installlation of facefinder+ 
-Step1: Open chrome and search for Google Teachable Machines website(https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and click on Get started. 


-Step2: And under the New Project section, select the Image Model folder.


-Step3: Select the Standard Image Model option.


-Step4: Determine the Required classes and upload the photos using webcam and google drive, And Train the Model. You could see the comparision percentage for the given classes.


-Step5: Click on Export the Model.
-Step6: Under the tensorflow tab, select Download the model option. And a .zip file would be downloaded. 


-Step8: To run it in local system, paste the Given code in pycharm or any other code Interpreter.
-Step9: Open the .zip file and copy the .h5 file and .txt file. And the save the files to the project path to Run the code.

-Step10: Open the terminal and install the required libraries for the project.
Tip-- chech the right python versions and tensorflow versions to avoid the syntax errors.
-Step11: Run the code and, Hence the facefinder+ works.
